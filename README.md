## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While I technically already had some knowledge on the use of CSS Grid, this project allowemd me to actually put those skill to use and made me actually think of how I would go about building the grid, calculating the numbers of rows and columns, etc. It took a bit for me to come up with a way to actually get the cards layed out as the challenge required, but it was worth it since it made me pay closer attention to the ins and out of grid construction. 

### Useful resources

- [Learn CSS Grid the easy way](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE&t=212s&pp=ygUIY3NzIGdyaWQ%3D) - This helped me as a refresher on the fundamentals of CSS Grid. Kevin Powell does a great job of providing thorough yet enticing explanations on how everything works.

- [Learn CSS Grid - A 13 Minute Deep Dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiNiSFIPIQE&t=212s) - This video by Slaying The Dragon is as concise and to-the-point as it gets and, in my case, provided a quick and useful explanation of the grid-area property.
